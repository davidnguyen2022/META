Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.
<p>
No matter how much the dog barks: <strong>don't feed him chocolate</strong>.
</p>

Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text
<p>
   The primary colors are <b>red</b>, <b>yellow</b> and <b>blue</b>.
</p>


Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.
<p>
   The term <i>HTML</i> stands for HyperText Markup Language.
</p>

Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.
<p>
   Wake up <em>now</em>!
</p>


Lists can be unordered using the <ul> tag. 
List items are specified using the <li> tag, for example:

<ul>
   <li>Tea</li>
   <li>Sugar</li>
   <li>Milk</li>
</ul>


Lists can also be ordered using the <ol> tag. 
Again, list items are specified using the <li> tag.


<ol>
   <li>Rocky</li>
   <li>Rocky II</li>
   <li>Rocky III</li>
</ol>




A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.

The following example shows a <div> element that contains a paragraph element:

<div>
   <p>This is a paragraph inside a div</p>
</div>


It can be nested inside other elements, for example:

<div>
   <div>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside a div that’s inside another div</p>
   </div>
</div>


As mentioned, the div has no impact on content unless it is styled by CSS. Let’s add a small CSS rule that styles all divs on the page.

Don't worry about the meaning of the CSS just yet, you'll explore CSS further in a later lesson. 
In summary, you're applying a rule that adds a border and some visual spacing to the element.

<style>
   div {
      border: 1px solid black;
      padding: 2px;
   }
</style>
<div>
   <div>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside stylized divs</p>
   </div>
</div>

-->

This is a paragraph. This is a practice HTML document.
